# reachy-mini-cli

CLI and agent for operating the Reachy Mini expressive robot — device setup, app
management, runtime motion, higher-level behaviors, and sound orienting. Commands
talk to the `reachy-mini-daemon` over an HTTP transport (default) or the
in-process `reachy_mini` SDK. Install the daemon binary with the `[daemon]` extra
(`uv tool install 'reachy-mini-cli[daemon]'`), then run `reachy-mini-cli
quickstart` for the install-and-start-real-mode sequence.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli quickstart` — copy-paste install + start-real-mode steps.
- `reachy-mini-cli whoami` — identity probe from `culture.yaml`.
- `reachy-mini-cli learn` — structured self-teaching prompt.
- `reachy-mini-cli explain <path>` — markdown docs for any noun/verb.
- `reachy-mini-cli overview` — descriptive snapshot of the agent.
- `reachy-mini-cli doctor` — check the agent-identity invariants.
- `reachy-mini-cli cli overview` — describe the CLI surface.

## Robot nouns

- `reachy-mini-cli daemon <verb>` — start/stop/check the local daemon process.
- `reachy-mini-cli device <verb>` — daemon/robot status and live state.
- `reachy-mini-cli app <verb>` — list/start/stop Reachy Mini apps.
- `reachy-mini-cli move <verb>` — runtime motion (goto, wake, sleep).
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode <verb>` — start/stop a background loop that makes
  the robot feel alive (idle breathing, glances, antenna sway).
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior <verb>` — compose behaviors on a 50 Hz loop
  (`list`, `run`, `stop`, `status`, `engine`).
- `reachy-mini-cli listen <verb>` — orient the head toward sound on a two-tier
  SDK-first loop (`run`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`).

The `device`/`app`/`move` verbs speak to the Reachy daemon over a transport
flavor (`--transport http` by default, `sdk` optional); a missing daemon yields a
clean exit-2 error, never a traceback. `daemon` is the other half — it brings the
local `reachy-mini-daemon` process up so those verbs have something to talk to.

_DAEMON = """\
# reachy-mini-cli daemon

Local daemon process lifecycle. The `device`/`app`/`move` verbs are *clients* of
a running daemon; this noun is the other half — it brings the local
`reachy-mini-daemon` process up and down.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli daemon start` — spawn `reachy-mini-daemon` in the background,
  record its PID + log under the state dir, and poll the health route
  (`GET /api/daemon/status`) until it answers. Idempotent: if a daemon already
  runs (tracked or foreign), it reports `already-running` instead of double-spawning.
- `reachy-mini-cli daemon stop` — SIGTERM the daemon this CLI started, escalating
  to SIGKILL if it lingers past `--timeout`.
- `reachy-mini-cli daemon status` — reconcile the tracked process (running /
  stopped / stale pid) with the HTTP health check.
- `reachy-mini-cli daemon overview` — this summary.

## Install

The daemon binary ships in the `[daemon]` extra — the recommended default:

    pip install 'reachy-mini-cli[daemon]'

The bare `pip install reachy-mini-cli` is the HTTP-only *remote* profile (no daemon):
use it on a control box that only talks to a daemon running elsewhere via
`--base-url` / `REACHY_BASE_URL`. If the binary is missing, `daemon start` exits 2
with a hint pointing at the `[daemon]` install.

## Notes

- `reachy-mini-daemon` defaults to `--wake-up-on-start`, so `daemon start` already
  wakes the robot. Forward daemon args after `--`, e.g.
  `reachy-mini-cli daemon start -- --sim --no-wake-up-on-start`.
- Override the launch command with `--daemon-cmd` or `REACHY_DAEMON_CMD`.
- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`
  (`~/.local/state/reachy`): `daemon.pid` + `daemon.log`.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli daemon status --json
    reachy-mini-cli daemon start --no-wait -- --sim

"""


_DEMO = """\
# reachy-mini-cli demo-mode

Make the robot *feel alive*. A continuously-running loop streams gentle idle
motion to the robot — a slow breathing oscillation, the occasional glance to a
new gaze target, and a little antenna sway — so an otherwise idle robot looks
present rather than frozen. The motion is a stream of `move goto` calls over the
transport, so it needs a running daemon (`reachy-mini-cli daemon start`).

It is meant to run always-on and improve over time, so it has three layers:
a tracked **process** (start/stop/restart), a persisted **config** file, and an
optional systemd `--user` **service**.

## Process verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode start` — spawn the loop in the background, recording
  its PID + log under the state dir. For `--transport http` it first preflights
  the daemon's health route so it never spawns a loop with nothing to drive.
  Idempotent: reports `already-running` if a tracked loop is alive.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode stop` — SIGTERM the loop this CLI started (so it
  eases the robot back to neutral before exiting), escalating to SIGKILL past
  `--timeout`.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode restart` — apply an update. If the systemd service
  is active it is restarted; otherwise the background loop is stopped and
  relaunched. Either way the new process re-imports the latest motion code and
  re-reads the config.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode status` — the loop's process state (running /
  stopped / stale), the systemd unit state, and whether the daemon answers.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode run` — run the loop in the foreground (what `start`
  and the service launch). Ctrl-C stops it. `--max-ticks N` runs a fixed number
  of poses.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode overview` — this summary.

## Config

`demo-mode config` reads/writes the persisted tuning at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/reachy/demo-mode.json`. `run`/`start` read it; CLI flags
override per-invocation (precedence: flag > config file > built-in default).

- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode config` — show the resolved config + its path.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode config --init` — write a default config file.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode config --set energy=0.8 interval=3` — set keys.

Keys: `transport`, `base_url`, `timeout`, `interval`, `energy`, `interpolation`,
`seed`, `wake`, `settle`. Tuning meaning:

- `interval` — seconds between poses (tempo; default 2.5).
- `energy` — liveliness multiplier scaling every amplitude (default 1.0;
  `0` is nearly still, `>1` is bigger motion).
- `interpolation` — `{minjerk,linear,ease,cartoon}` curve between poses.
- `seed` — make the idle motion reproducible (`none` for random).
- `wake` / `settle` — wake on start / ease to neutral on stop (override with
  the `--no-wake` / `--no-settle` flags).

## Service (systemd --user)

Run it always-on, auto-restarting on crash and starting on boot:

- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode install` — write the `reachy-demo-mode.service` unit
  (ExecStart re-invokes `demo-mode run --config <path>`).
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode enable` — `systemctl --user enable --now` + enable
  linger so it survives logout/reboot (`--no-linger` to skip).
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode disable` — `systemctl --user disable --now`.
- `reachy-mini-cli demo-mode uninstall` — remove the unit file.

Without a systemd user session these exit `2` with a hint; use start/stop instead.

{transports}

## Notes

- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`:
  `demo-mode.pid` + `demo-mode.log`.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli daemon start                       # something for the loop to drive

_BEHAVIOR = """\
# reachy-mini-cli behavior

Compose robot behaviors on a 50 Hz control loop. A persistent **engine** holds a
set of active behaviors; you push behaviors onto it from separate commands, and a
per-channel contention model decides who drives each part of the robot when they
conflict. `feel-alive` runs as a passive base layer, so an idle robot keeps
breathing on any channel nothing else claims.

The engine streams *immediate* `set_target` poses, so **it owns motion
exclusively while running** — don't drive the robot with `move goto` / `demo-mode`
at the same time. The http transport needs a running daemon
(`reachy-mini-cli daemon start`).

## Channels and contention

Behaviors claim one or more **channels** — `head`, `antennas`, `body_yaw` — and
carry a contention **class**:

- `passive` — drives a channel only when nothing else claims it; yields instantly.
- `stoppable` — drives, but a newly-started `stopping` behavior removes it.
- `unstoppable` — holds its channels until it finishes on its own; never removed.
- `stopping` — on start, stops the `stoppable` behaviors sharing its channels.

Same-channel conflicts resolve by class priority
(`unstoppable` > `stopping` > `stoppable` > `passive`), then by most-recent.

## Lifetime

- one-shot (`--once`) — runs once for `--duration` seconds, then expires;
- looping (`--loop`) — repeats until `--duration` elapses, or forever (no
  duration) until stopped.

Each behavior has a natural default (e.g. `gaze-hold` is one-shot, `speak` loops).

## Sensing

All built-in behaviors are pure motion. For **sound-orienting**, see the dedicated
`reachy-mini-cli listen` noun (`reachy-mini-cli explain listen`): it drives the
daemon's smooth minjerk `goto` planner instead of the engine's `set_target`
stream, which is jerky for big reorienting turns. (The engine keeps a general
capability to feed a sensor-driven behavior a live reading, but ships none today.)

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli behavior list` — the built-in catalog (names, channels,
  default class, parameters). No robot needed.
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior run <name> [--set k=v ...] [--class CLASS]
  [--channels ...] [--once|--loop] [--duration N]` — push a behavior onto the
  engine (auto-starts it). Reports what it admitted / evicted / is blocked on.
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior stop <id|name|all>` — stop a running behavior
  (`all` keeps the passive base layer).
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior status` — active behaviors, per-channel ownership,
  and engine/daemon state.
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior engine start|stop|status|run` — manage the 50 Hz
  engine process (start/stop in the background, or `run` in the foreground).
- `reachy-mini-cli behavior overview` — the verb summary.

{transports}

## Notes

- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`:
  `behavior/engine.pid`, `behavior/engine.log`, and a command spool +
  `state.json` the CLI and engine talk through.
- The engine tick rate is `--compose-hz` (default 50); the base layer's
  liveliness is `--energy`; disable the base layer with `--no-base-layer`.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli daemon start                         # something to drive
    reachy-mini-cli behavior engine start                # bring the 50 Hz loop up

""".replace(_TRANSPORTS_SLOT, _TRANSPORTS)


_VISION = """\
# reachy-mini-cli vision

Orient the robot toward what it *sees* in real time. `vision` is **SDK-first** and
**local-profile only**: frames come from the camera via the in-process `reachy_mini`
SDK (the `sdk` transport is the default). No frames are streamed over HTTP — running
with `--transport http` gives camera-metadata-only access (`vision specs`); `vision run`
and the background process (`start`/`stop`/`restart`) require the local `sdk` transport.

**Pixel-based; no ML and no GPU.** Detection is pure pixel math that runs on any
hardware without a GPU:

- **Motion (primary cue) — frame differencing:** consecutive frames are subtracted
  and thresholded; the centroid of the motion-heavy region is mapped to a yaw offset
  and drives a head turn toward the moving object.
- **Light (fallback cue) — brightness/centroid:** when no motion fires, the weighted
  brightness centroid of the frame is computed; a significant shift in the centroid
  triggers a softer look toward the bright region.

Like `listen`, `vision` mirrors the serial-motion-queue design: both tiers drive the
daemon's smooth minjerk `goto` planner strictly one move at a time, so turns are soft
and never conflict. The loop runs only when the daemon is reachable and a camera frame
is available; if either is absent it exits cleanly (exit 2) rather than crashing.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli vision run` — run the loop in the foreground; Ctrl-C stops it.
  `--max-ticks N` runs a fixed number of ticks. Eases to center on start and on stop.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision start` — spawn the loop in the background, recording its
  PID + log under the state dir. Idempotent: reports `already-running` if a tracked
  loop is alive.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision stop` — SIGTERM the loop this CLI started (so it eases
  back to center before exiting), escalating to SIGKILL past `--timeout`.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision restart` — stop the tracked loop and relaunch it, so the
  new process re-reads the tuning and the latest code.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision status` — the loop's process state (running / stopped /
  stale) and whether the daemon answers.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision specs` — report camera metadata (resolution, name,
  intrinsics). This verb is remote-safe: it works with `--transport http` because
  the daemon REST API serves camera metadata without streaming frames.
- `reachy-mini-cli vision overview` — the verb summary.

## Tuning

Feel knobs (each defaults to a tuned value; unset keeps it):

- `--gain X` — direction-to-head-yaw scaling factor.
- `--max-yaw DEG` — maximum head yaw toward a visual target.
- `--deadband DEG` — ignore targets within this angle of the current heading.
- `--hold SECONDS` — after a turn, stay there this long before reconsidering.
- `--speed DEG_PER_S` — slew speed for turns and for easing back to center.
- `--motion-threshold X` — minimum motion magnitude to trigger a head turn; lower =
  more sensitive; higher = only large moves fire.

## Transport

The `sdk` transport (default) reads camera frames via `reachy_mini` in-process —
requires the `[sdk]` / `[daemon]` extra. The `http` transport polls the daemon's
camera-metadata endpoint; use it with `--transport http` or `REACHY_TRANSPORT=http`
for a remote control box or to run `vision specs` without the SDK installed.

## Notes

- Camera was previously unused by the CLI — this is a net-new perception channel.
- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`: `vision.pid`
  and `vision.log`.
- Only one thing should drive the robot at a time — don't run `vision` alongside
  `listen`, `demo-mode`, or the behavior engine.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli vision specs                               # check camera metadata
    reachy-mini-cli daemon start                              # bring the daemon up

"""


_SAY = """\
# reachy-mini-cli say

Synthesize text and play it through the robot speaker. A *dumb pipe*: text →
TTS synthesis → playback. No LLM, no senses, no event bus — `say` is
deliberately boundary-clean so agents can compose it into pipelines without
pulling in the heavier speech stack.

Pass `"-"` as the text argument to read from stdin (e.g.
`echo "hello" | reachy-mini-cli say run -`).

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli say run <text>` — synthesize the given text (or stdin with
  `"-"`) and play it through the robot speaker.
- `reachy-mini-cli say overview` — this summary.

## TTS

The TTS step calls a Magpie-style HTTP endpoint (default `http://localhost:9000`,
override with `--tts-url` / `REACHY_TTS_URL`). The voice identifier can be set
with `--voice` / `REACHY_TTS_VOICE`. The `--speed` flag is accepted (forwarded
to the server) for forward compatibility.

## Playback transport

- `sdk` (default) — pushes PCM audio frames to the robot speaker via the
  in-process `reachy_mini` SDK. Requires the `[sdk]` / `[daemon]` extra.
- `http` — sends a single POST to the daemon's `/media/play` route. Use with
  `--transport http` / `REACHY_TRANSPORT=http` for a remote control box.

`--base-url` / `REACHY_BASE_URL` sets the daemon URL for `http` playback.

## Boundary invariant

`say` MUST NOT import `reachy.speech.llm` or `reachy.speech.events`. Tests
assert this. Keep `say` as a pure TTS → playback pipe.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli say run "Hello from Reachy"
    echo "Hello from stdin" | reachy-mini-cli say run -
    reachy-mini-cli say run "Test" --voice en_US --tts-url http://localhost:9000

_THINK_DEMO = """\
# reachy-mini-cli think demo

Run a scripted `*emoji* "speech"` stream through the real expression + TTS
pipeline, so a human can verify the body-expression wiring on a live robot

The built-in script is:

    *🤔* "I wonder what that sound was."
    *👂* "There it is again, to my left."
    *🙂* "Ah — it's just the fan."

Each `*emoji*` marker enqueues exactly one calm gesture via
`ExpressionProducer`; each quoted phrase is synthesized via TTS and played
through the robot speaker. The cognition-active signal is raised for the
duration of the demo so a co-running `listen` backs off its idle motion.

_THINK = """\
# reachy-mini-cli think

Think out loud about what the robot perceives. A continuous cognition loop: on
each turn the robot's live senses are snapshotted into an event buffer, the LLM
produces one or two first-person sentences, each sentence is synthesized via TTS
and played through the speaker while the LLM is still generating the next one
(sentence-streamed), so speech starts before the turn is complete.

The sense feed mirrors `listen`: DoA (direction of arrival) and mic loudness
are read per tick via the SDK transport (default) or the daemon's DoA HTTP route
(`--transport http`). Both feed the `EventBuffer` through a `before_turn` hook.
An empty buffer (no notable sounds since the last turn) is a no-op — no LLM call,
no audio.

Like `daemon`, `think` has both a foreground loop (`run`) and a tracked
background process (`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`) managed by its own
supervisor (`reachy/speech/supervisor.py`, distinct from `listen`'s).

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli think run` — run the cognition loop in the foreground; Ctrl-C
  stops it. `--max-turns N` stops after N spoken turns; `--max-ticks N` stops
  after N loop iterations (idle turns included).
- `reachy-mini-cli think start` — spawn the loop in the background, recording
  its PID + log under the state dir.
- `reachy-mini-cli think stop` — stop the loop this CLI started.
- `reachy-mini-cli think restart` — stop and relaunch the background loop
  (re-reads flags and latest code).
- `reachy-mini-cli think status` — the loop's process state (running / stopped
  / stale pid).
- `reachy-mini-cli think expressions` — list the expression catalog (emoji +
  pose descriptor); `expressions check` flags poses too similar to be distinct.
- `reachy-mini-cli think overview` — this summary.

## Expressions

While thinking, the robot gestures: the LLM may emit `*emoji*` expression
markers (and wraps spoken text in `"quotes"`). Each marker enqueues one calm
gesture from the expression catalog onto a serial motion queue, drained one move
at a time to the robot — `think` never streams `set_target` poses. The available
emoji vocabulary is advertised to the LLM in its system prompt, pulled live from
the catalog. Inspect the catalog with `think expressions` / `think expressions
check`.

## Cognition signal

While `run` is active it publishes a file flag (`think_active.flag` under the
state dir) so other subsystems (e.g. idle motion) can back off; the flag is
cleared on every exit path, including Ctrl-C and errors.

## LLM endpoint

Configure with `--llm-base-url` / `REACHY_OPENAI_URL_BASE` (base URL),
`--llm-model` / `REACHY_OPENAI_MODEL_ID` (model name), and `REACHY_OPENAI_API_KEY`
(bearer key, only sent when present). The legacy `REACHY_LLM_BASE_URL` /
`REACHY_LLM_MODEL` / `REACHY_LLM_API_KEY` names still work as a fallback. The
client is a pure `urllib`-based streaming HTTP client (no new base dep; no
`openai` SDK required).

## TTS endpoint

Same as `say`: `--tts-url` / `REACHY_TTS_URL`, `--voice` / `REACHY_TTS_VOICE`.
`think` reuses `say`'s speech leg (`reachy.speech.tts.synthesize` +
`reachy.speech.playback.play_audio`).

## Playback transport

- `sdk` (default) — pushes PCM via `reachy_mini`; requires `[sdk]` / `[daemon]`.
- `http` — sends PCM to the daemon's `/media/play` HTTP route.

## Pacing

`--turn-interval` (seconds between turns; default from `CognitionEngine`).
`--max-turns` bounds a run to N spoken turns. `--max-ticks` bounds by loop
iterations (useful for testing: idle ticks count, spoken turns don't).

## Transport (sense feed)

- `sdk` (default) — opens a `ReachyMini` media session in-process; reads real
  DoA + mic RMS per tick.
- `http` — polls the daemon's DoA route; no audio source (RMS treated as 0).

## Notes

- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`: `think.pid`
  and `think.log`.
- `think` has its own supervisor (`reachy/speech/supervisor.py`), separate from
  `listen`'s `reachy/motion/supervisor.py` — they track different processes.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli daemon start                             # bring the daemon up
    reachy-mini-cli think run                                # foreground loop (Ctrl-C to stop)
    reachy-mini-cli think run --max-turns 3                  # stop after 3 spoken turns
    reachy-mini-cli think start --llm-model mistral-small    # background process
    reachy-mini-cli think status --json
    reachy-mini-cli think stop
    reachy-mini-cli think restart                            # apply code/config updates
"""


_LISTEN = """\
# reachy-mini-cli listen

Orient the robot toward sound in real time. `listen` is **SDK-first**: it streams
live audio from the mic array via the `reachy_mini` SDK (the `sdk` transport is the
default), so DoA and loudness are computed in-process — no round-trip to the daemon.
The HTTP transport remains available via `--transport http` / `REACHY_TRANSPORT=http`
for a control box talking to a remote daemon.

## Two-tier reaction

The loop runs two tiers simultaneously:

**Tier 1 — antenna lean (always on):** A lightweight, near-continuous lean of the
*antennas* (and head holds position) toward the incoming DoA on every tick. This gives
the robot a subtle "perked ear" reaction to any live sound, even faint ambient noise,
without moving the body.

**Tier 2 — head→body turn (speech or loud snap):** On detected *speech* or a loud
RMS transient ("snap") — a sudden noise spike above a ratio × floor threshold — the
robot executes a slow, smooth head→body turn:

1. The head turns toward the source first.
2. If the source is beyond `--head-only-band` degrees from center, the body rotates
   to face the source and the head re-centers, so the whole robot is re-oriented.

A **latched-DoA guard** prevents stale angles from triggering a spurious turn: the
daemon's DoA angle freezes at rest, so Tier-2 fires only on live speech/snap, never
on the last angle left over from a previous sound.

**Always-alive idle (between sounds):** when nothing reactive fires, the robot
keeps gently moving — breathing, a slow gaze wander, and antenna sway — *around its
current heading*, so it is never frozen. A robot that turned toward a sound stays
rotated and keeps wandering there; after `--recenter-after` seconds of silence the
head and body drift slowly back toward front (`--drift-speed` deg/s) rather than
hard-snapping home. `--idle-energy 0` restores the old hold-still behaviour.

The `SnapDetector` (`reachy/motion/snap.py`) implements the RMS spike detection,
algorithm cited from `reachy_nova`'s `TrackingManager.detect_snap`.

Unlike the behavior engine — which streams immediate `set_target` poses at 50 Hz
(jerky for big reorienting turns) — this loop drives the smooth minjerk `goto`
planner and runs moves strictly one at a time through a serial motion queue.

It degrades gracefully: no mic, a DoA error, or (with `--speech-only`) no speech ⇒
no reaction, no crash.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli listen run` — run the loop in the foreground (what `start` and
  the process launch run). Ctrl-C stops it; `--max-ticks N` runs a fixed number of
  ticks. Eases to center on start (preflight) and on stop.
- `reachy-mini-cli listen start` — spawn the loop in the background, recording its
  PID + log under the state dir. For `--transport http` it first preflights the
  daemon's health route. Idempotent: reports `already-running` if a tracked loop
  is alive.
- `reachy-mini-cli listen stop` — SIGTERM the loop this CLI started (so it eases
  back to center before exiting), escalating to SIGKILL past `--timeout`.
- `reachy-mini-cli listen restart` — stop the tracked loop and relaunch it, so the
  new process re-reads the tuning and the latest code.
- `reachy-mini-cli listen status` — the loop's process state (running / stopped /
  stale) and whether the daemon answers.
- `reachy-mini-cli listen overview` — the verb summary.

## Tuning

Feel knobs (each defaults to a tuned value; unset keeps it):

- `--gain X` — DoA-to-head-yaw scaling factor.
- `--deadband DEG` — ignore sound within this angle of the current heading.
- `--hold SECONDS` — after a Tier-2 turn, stay there this long before reconsidering.
- `--speed DEG_PER_S` — slew speed for Tier-2 turns and for easing back to center.
- `--recenter-after SECONDS` — silence grace before the head/body start drifting home.
- `--idle-energy X` — liveliness of the always-alive idle motion (0 = hold still).
- `--drift-speed DEG_PER_S` — how fast the head/body drift home after silence.
- `--speech-only` — Tier-2 reacts only to detected speech (Tier-1 still runs).
- `--antenna-max DEG` — maximum antenna lean angle for Tier-1.
- `--body-yaw-max DEG` — maximum body yaw for Tier-2 body rotation.
- `--head-only-band DEG` — source angles within this band stay head-only (no body
  rotation); outside it the body turns and the head re-centers.
- `--snap-ratio X` — RMS spike must be this many times the floor to count as a snap.
- `--snap-floor RMS` — minimum floor RMS below which snap detection is suppressed.

## Live mode

- `--live` — fold `think` + `vision` + `sleep` into this one loop (alongside the
  head-pat hook), so every sense rides the one SDK media session and the one motion
  queue in one process. `sdk`-only. This is the loop the `live` boot presence runs.
- `--transcribe` — (requires `--live`, `sdk`-only) transcribe nearby speech via the
  external STT service (model-gear / Parakeet at `REACHY_STT_URL`, default
  `localhost:9002`) and feed the recognised **words** into live cognition, so the
  robot reasons about *what* was said, not just that a sound came from a direction.
  Off by default; when off the live loop is unchanged and no STT request is made. A
  self-mute window after each spoken clip drops the robot's own voice (it never
  transcribes itself); an unreachable STT degrades to "no words" and never stalls
  the loop. Not a dialogue/turn-taking assistant — words are one more perception.

## Transport

The `sdk` transport (default) streams mic audio via `reachy_mini` in-process —
`reachy-mini` and `numpy` are base runtime dependencies. The `http` transport polls
the daemon's DoA endpoint instead; use it with `--transport http` or
`REACHY_TRANSPORT=http` on a control box that talks to a remote daemon.

## Notes

- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`: `listen.pid`
  and `listen.log`.
- Only one thing should drive the robot at a time — don't run `listen` alongside
  `demo-mode` or the behavior engine.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli daemon start                              # bring the daemon up
    reachy-mini-cli listen run                                # foreground, SDK transport (default)
    reachy-mini-cli listen run --transport http               # foreground, HTTP transport

"""


_PAT = """\
# reachy-mini-cli pat

Feel a head pat and lean into it. A proprioceptive reactive loop: the robot holds
a neutral baseline head pose, reads the *actual* head pose back each tick, and feeds
the commanded-vs-actual deviation to a `PatDetector`. When the detector recognises a
pat it fires an event and `PatReaction` enqueues a calm lean→nuzzle→settle gesture
onto the shared serial `MotionQueue`, drained one move at a time to the robot by a
background motion executor — the same architecture as `listen` and `think`.

Two **touch types**:

- `scratch` — a head-press (pitch deviation): the robot dips its head into the touch.
- `side_pat` — a sideways nudge (yaw deviation): the robot turns toward the hand.

Two **intensities**: `level1` (light touch) and `level2` (sustained/firmer touch).
Each combination produces a distinct lean gesture — the reaction is scaled by level.

Detection is **proprioceptive**: there is no physical touch sensor. The detector
infers a pat from the difference between the commanded pose and the actual pose
reported by the SDK (`head_pose` read-back). A transient pose deviation that matches
the scratch or side-nudge pattern — enough presses within a sliding window above the
press threshold — fires a detection event.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli pat run` — run the foreground proprioceptive loop (SDK-first by
  default); Ctrl-C stops it. `--ticks N` stops after N loop ticks (useful for
  ops/testing). `--press-threshold DEG` and `--min-presses N` tune the detector.
- `reachy-mini-cli pat demo` — synthesize the scripted pat events through
  `PatReaction` with **no robot and no `[sdk]` extra**; emits the enqueued action
  labels so the lean wiring can be verified in CI or on any machine. `--count N`
  limits the number of scripted events played. `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `reachy-mini-cli pat overview` — this summary.

## Transport

`pat` is **SDK-first**: `head_pose` read-back is an SDK-only capability. The `http`
transport is accepted via `--transport http` / `REACHY_TRANSPORT=http` for non-pose
operations, but attempting a `run` over `http` raises a clean exit-2 `CliError`
("not supported on this transport") — never a traceback. A missing `[sdk]` extra also
raises a clean exit-2 `CliError` pointing at the extra before the loop starts.

## Motion

Lean gestures are enqueued onto a serial `MotionQueue` and drained one move at a
time by a background `_MotionExecutor` thread. A transport drop inside the executor
degrades motion to silent — the pat sensing loop keeps running. The queue is flushed
(best effort) on shutdown so any in-flight lean completes before exit.

## Notes

- `demo` requires no robot and no `[sdk]` extra — safe to run in CI and on a
  plain dev machine to exercise the lean planner end-to-end.
- `--ticks N` is handy for bounded ops runs or automated tests.
- Only one thing should drive the robot at a time — don't run `pat` alongside
  `demo-mode`, `listen`, or another motion source.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli pat run                          # foreground loop, SDK transport
    reachy-mini-cli pat run --ticks 100              # stop after 100 ticks
    reachy-mini-cli pat run --press-threshold 1.5    # stiffer detection threshold
    reachy-mini-cli pat demo                         # verify lean wiring, no robot
    reachy-mini-cli pat demo --count 2 --json        # first 2 events, JSON output
    reachy-mini-cli pat overview                     # this summary
"""


_SLEEP = """\
# reachy-mini-cli sleep

Drift off when undisturbed, wake on a stimulus. A graduated-wakefulness loop: an
idle timer walks the robot ALERT → DROWSY → ASLEEP the longer it goes
undisturbed. Any qualifying stimulus — detected speech, a sound-direction (DoA)
shift, a loud snap transient, or a pat — snaps it back to ALERT with a single
re-engagement gesture.

Each wakefulness state maps to motion through the `SleepProducer`: full-energy
alive idle when ALERT, a low-energy idle when DROWSY, and a near-still
"sleep breathe" (slow body rock + gentle antenna breathing + a slight head
droop) when ASLEEP. Moves are submitted onto the shared serial `MotionQueue` and
drained one move at a time by a background motion executor — the same
architecture as `listen`, `think`, and `pat`.

While the robot is ASLEEP the noun keeps the `sleep_active.flag` written (under
the state dir) so other subsystems can quiet themselves; it is cleared the moment
the robot is no longer asleep, and on every exit path.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli sleep run` — run the decay→sleep→wake loop in the foreground
  (SDK-first by default); Ctrl-C stops it. `--ticks N` stops after N loop ticks
  (useful for ops/testing). `--idle-timeout SECONDS` sets the quiet time before
  sleep (the drowsy threshold is half of it).
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep start` — spawn the loop in the background, recording its
  PID + log under the state dir. Idempotent: reports `already-running` if a
  tracked loop is alive.
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep stop` — SIGTERM the loop this CLI started, escalating to
  SIGKILL past `--timeout`.
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep restart` — stop the tracked loop and relaunch it, so the
  new process re-reads the tuning and the latest code.
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep status` — the current sleep state + idle seconds and the
  loop's process state (running / stopped / stale).
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep demo` — walk the full ALERT→DROWSY→ASLEEP→wake arc
  against a synthetic sense sequence + a fake clock, with **no robot and no
  `[sdk]` extra**; the observed state sequence is reported (use `--json`).
- `reachy-mini-cli sleep overview` — this summary.

## Transport

`sleep` is **SDK-first**: the `sdk` transport (default) opens a `reachy_mini`
media session in-process and reads real DoA + mic loudness per tick — requires
the `[sdk]` / `[daemon]` extra. The `http` transport polls the daemon's DoA route
(no audio source, so the snap cue is inert); use it with `--transport http` /
`REACHY_TRANSPORT=http` for a remote control box. A missing `[sdk]` extra raises a
clean exit-2 `CliError` pointing at the extra — never a traceback. `demo` needs no
transport at all.

## Notes

- `demo` requires no robot and no `[sdk]` extra — safe to run in CI and on a
  plain dev machine to exercise the full state arc end-to-end.
- State lives under `$REACHY_STATE_DIR` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/reachy`: `sleep.pid`,
  `sleep.log`, and the `sleep_active.flag`.
- Only one thing should drive the robot at a time — don't run `sleep` alongside
  `listen`, `demo-mode`, or another motion source.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli sleep run                          # foreground loop, SDK transport
    reachy-mini-cli sleep run --idle-timeout 60        # nod off after 60s of quiet
    reachy-mini-cli sleep run --ticks 100              # stop after 100 ticks
    reachy-mini-cli sleep demo                         # walk the arc, no robot
    reachy-mini-cli sleep demo --json                  # machine-readable arc

    reachy-mini-cli sleep stop
"""


_SERVICE = """\
# reachy-mini-cli service

Make the robot boot-persistent in **exactly one** presence mode. The robot has a
single presence at a time (the single-SDK-owner model): either the idle
`demo-mode` loop or the folded live sense loop (`listen run --live`) — never both.
This noun installs systemd `--user` units so that one chosen presence survives a
reboot and auto-restarts on crash, and enabling one mode always disables the
sibling (the single-presence-owner invariant).

Like `daemon`, `service` does **not** drive the robot through a transport — it
talks to **systemd** (`systemctl --user`), so there is no `--transport` flag.

## Three units

- `reachy-daemon.service` — the local `reachy-mini-daemon` process. A boot
  dependency: both presence units `Requires=` / `After=` it, so the daemon comes
  up first. `disable` leaves the daemon enabled deliberately (other clients of
  the robot depend on it).
- `reachy-demo-mode.service` — the idle `demo-mode run` presence loop.
- `reachy-live.service` — the folded live loop (`listen run --live`): hearing +
  pat + think + vision + sleep in one process.

## Verbs

- `reachy-mini-cli service enable demo` — boot-persist the idle demo-mode
  presence; disables the live sibling.
- `reachy-mini-cli service enable live` — boot-persist the folded live sense
  loop; disables the demo sibling.
- `reachy-mini-cli service disable` — disable whichever presence unit is enabled
  (the daemon is left enabled, reported as `daemon=left-enabled`).
- `reachy-mini-cli service status` — which presence mode is enabled (or none) +
  per-unit `is-enabled` / `is-active` + daemon health.
- `reachy-mini-cli service install` — write all three unit files +
  `daemon-reload`, WITHOUT enabling anything (a separate `enable` chooses the
  mode).
- `reachy-mini-cli service uninstall` — remove the unit files + `daemon-reload`.
- `reachy-mini-cli service overview` — this summary.

## Boot persistence (systemd --user)

The presence runs as a `systemctl --user` service. For it to start at machine
boot (before you log in), the user session needs **linger**
(`loginctl enable-linger $USER`); otherwise it starts at first login. A true
machine-reboot check is therefore a manual on-robot step.

## Notes

- Unit files live under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user`
  (`~/.config/systemd/user`).
- A missing `systemctl` on PATH raises a clean exit-2 `CliError`; an invalid mode
  is an exit-1 user error — never a traceback.
- Every verb supports `--json`, results to stdout / errors+diagnostics to stderr.

## Usage

    reachy-mini-cli service install                  # write the units, enable nothing
    reachy-mini-cli service enable live              # boot-persist the live loop
    reachy-mini-cli service enable demo              # switch to idle demo (disables live)
    reachy-mini-cli service status --json            # enabled mode + daemon health
    reachy-mini-cli service disable                  # stop the presence (daemon stays up)
    reachy-mini-cli service uninstall                # remove the units
