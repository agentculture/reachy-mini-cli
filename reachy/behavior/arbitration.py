"""The contention core — who owns each channel, and what an add evicts.

Two pure functions, no I/O, no clock:

* :func:`arbitrate` runs **every tick**: given the live behaviors (in admission
  order, oldest first), it assigns each channel a single owner by
  ``(class priority, recency)``.
* :func:`admit` runs **when a behavior is added**: a ``stopping`` behavior removes
  the ``stoppable`` behaviors it shares a channel with; everything else removes
  nothing. Admission is *total* — every behavior is accepted — so contention a
  newcomer cannot win by removal is simply resolved per tick (it waits, yielding
  the channel to a higher-priority incumbent until that incumbent ends).

This encodes the four-class model directly:

* **passive** — never removes anything and is only ever the per-tick owner of a
  channel no non-passive behavior claims (lowest priority);
* **stoppable** — drives, but is removed by a newly-admitted ``stopping`` on a
  shared channel;
* **unstoppable** — highest priority (owns its channels while alive) and is never
  removed by an add, so it "holds until it finishes itself";
* **stopping** — on admit, evicts the shared ``stoppable`` behaviors and takes
  over.
